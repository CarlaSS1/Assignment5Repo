Implement a series of classes to build a computer. A computer is a complex entity and consists of the following: 
1.	Hard Drive 
	a.	Capacity 
	b.	Type (SSD or HDD) 
	c.	Read speed 
	d.	Write speed 
2.	Motherboard 
	a.	Number of memory slots 
	b.	Power consumption 
	c.	Number of PCI slots 
	d.	Form factor 
	e.	Hard drive limit 
	f.	CPU 
	g.	Memory 
	h.	Graphics card 
3.	CPU 
	a.	Speed 
	b.	Manufacturer (Intel, AMD) 
	c.	Socket Type 
	d.	Cache size 
	e.	Number of cores 
4.	Memory 
	a.	Read speed 
	b.	Write speed 
	c.	Type (DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4) 
	d.	Amount in GB 
5.	Graphics card 
	a.	Fan count 
	b.	Speed 
	c.	Video memory 
	d.	Number of CUDA cores 
6.	Case 
	a.	Length 
	b.	Width 
	c.	Height 
	d.	Number of fans 
	e.	Number of vents 
Each class implemented should have error handling built in and throw exceptions when invalid or nonsensical information is provided, (i.e. a CPU cannot have a speed less than 0). All properties within each class must use the best datatype to represent the value, (i.e. CPU speed should be a double not an integer).
